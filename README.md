## What is my Project?

My project is an interactive piece of art portraying a nightime campsite. When you run the code itll open to a still image of the of the campside that I drew and with cricket chirping as background noise. Not only will it open to the campsite and crickets at the top a prompt is displayed asking you to "press A, W, or D for a bit of nightime fun". When those buttons are clicked they will trigger parts of the art to start animating. A animates the fire, W animates the fireflys, and D animates the owl. 

A little about each animation: The fire animation is just random movement of the fire kinda like how real fire behaves. The firefly animation is a gradual increase in the color brightness of their lights. Last but not least, the owl animation is him opening his eyes. His eyes they dilate. Then, he looks around before the dilate back to how they were and then closes his eyes again. Each animation ends how they began so that the transistion between repetitions is smooth and bring back the still image look.

In addition to their animations those same buttons, A, W, and D, also activate a sound effect that correlates to what is animating to play at the same time. The fire has a fire crackling sfx, the fireflys have a twinkling sfx, and the owl a hooting sfx. These sounds play on top of the background crickets as well as each other so if you wanted to hear them all at the the same time you could.
## What Does This Repository Consist Of?

This repository consist of 5 diffrent files.

First, is the src file. This contains my python code called project.py, all of the pngs my code needs to run through to give the illusion of animation, and the sound mp3's for the crickets, fire, twinkle, and hooting.

Second, is the README.md. This is what your reading now. A discription of what my project is, what my repository contains, and any design considerations I thought about.Also, the links to my repository and my video demonstration

Third, is the credits.md. This is a document listing all the resources I used that helped with the creation of this project.

Forth, is the preposal.md. This file talks about what the project is again, but it goes into all the features in detail and what I think will be needed for them. I discuss potential challenges and my ideal or minimum outcome of the project. I also listed my milestones for each week I had to work on this project at the bottom. Breaking it down into smaller pieces made it seem less daunting. Most importantly, the link to the repository is also in there.

Lastly, is a requirements text file. This is basically a list of all the third party pips I had to use in this project. 

## Design Considerations

One of my big design consideration was that I needed the background to be set at night. This is because I knew I wanted to have sounds in there eventually and when I thought of sound associated with camping practically all happen at night. Campfire are only really lit at night. Owls are nocturnal and therefore only come out at night. Fireflys dont make a sound, but I really wanted to include them. However, you can only ever see them at night. I also wanted the image when its still to feel calm and cozy. I dont know why but it just doesnt feel like that as much during the day as it would at night. Daytime brings harsher light, people, cars, etc. Thats take away from the cozy feel.

I also had to take into account, when deciding what things to animate in the nighttime scene, was actually doable for me. I am no 2d animator. I understang the gist of it, but I wouldnt say Im good at it. However, for the sake of this project and me not wanting to go searching for pngs animations online, I drew the animations myself and exported their pngs. Because I was drawing them and Im a beginner in 2d I had to think of animations I could definitely do and make look semi good. This led to the animations I have now where the movements are simpler, but still noticeably animating and cute.
## Future Improvements

One thing that Id love to improve with this project in the future is the fact that when I play the animations I have to wait till the animation is done before clicking it again. It wont just restart in the middle of a going animation which is what I would want because the sound works like that but the animation does not. Id like it to match with sound eventually
