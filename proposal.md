# Nighttime Fun 🌌
## Repository
  https://github.com/Kr1st3n-3/PFDA-final.git
## Description
  My program will show a nighttime camp scenery with stagnat assets: fireflys, owl, and fire. The player will be prompt to click specific buttons which when pushed will activate the animations and sound for the assets
## Features
  - Campsite Background:

    This feature wont do anything itll just be a png of a campsite that sits as the backgrounds scene. It sets the mood and feel of the game. I'll need pygame.image.load to open the png as the background and get it to load.
  - Instruction print:

    This is feature will be just a text message that will sit on the screen and promp the player to click buttons A, W, or D. I will probably need python.type to do this, but I'll definitely need to do more research for how to achieve it cause thats just a guess.
  - Firefly animation:
    
    The features it'll have is just to run through a pngs to give the illusion of animation when the W button is pressed. It'll start and end in the same position so that on the repeat after it flows nicely. I have a feeling im gonna need to use an if statement for the button, but that's 100% a guess. I'll probablly also need the clock feature
  - Owl animation:
    
    The features it'll have is just to run through a pngs to give the illusion of animation when the D button is pressed. It'll start and end in the same position so that on repeat after it flows nicely. I have a feeling im gonna need to use an if statement for the button, but tha's 100% a guess. I'll probablly also need the clock feature
  - Fire animation:
    
    The features it'll have is just to run through a number of pngs to give the illusion of animation when the A button is pressed. It'll start and end in the same position so that on the repeat after it flows nicely. I have a feeling im gonna need to use an if statement for the button, but that's 100% a guess. I'll probablly also need the clock feature
  - Firefly SFX:
    
    The feature of this is that when the same button, W, used to run the firefly animation is pressed it'll also play a twinkling sound mp3 so that theyre going at the same time. Google says that to to this I'll need .init() and the music in the same file.
  - Owl SFX:
    
    The feature of this is that when the same button, D, used to run the owl animation is pressed it'll also play an owl hooing mp3 so that theyre going at the same time. Google says that to to this I'll need .init() and the music in the same file.
  - Fire SFX:
    
    The feature of this is that when the same button, A, used to run the fire animation is pressed it'll also play a fire crackling sound mp3 so that theyre going at the same time. Google says that to to this I'll need .init() and the music in the same file.
    - Background Music:
    
    The feature of this is that when the game screen is run the sound cricket sound mp3 will start playing as background music coninuously on a loop until the game is closed. The other sound will also be able to play on top of it. Google says that to to this I'll need to import micer from pygame and have the music in the same file.

## Challenges
  For this to work ill need to learn/research and good handful of topics.

   First, I will need to research how to run animations in pygame. 

   Second, I need to learn how to get that animation to play only when I click a button and not constantly.

   Third, Ill need to learn how to input the music into pygame since Ive never actually done that before.

  Also, not really something Ill need to know cause I already know how to do it, but ill need to 2D animate these assets cause I'll need the png sequences of them to run the animations. I dont 2D animate often so I predict it'll be a challenge
## Outcomes

  ### Ideal Outcome
  My ideal outcome for this project is that everything is there when you run the program and all features work as expected. 
  ### Minimal Viable Outcome
  However, I feel like im underestimating how long and/or difficult this will be. So, my minimal outcome is that the scene opens, all the assets are there, and at least 2 animations work as intended. Everything else would be a bonus.
## Milestones

  ### Week 1 
☐ Able to open and close the pygame program

☐ Non-animated nightime scenery is viewable

☐ Animated png are in the file.
  ### Week 2
☐ Firefly is viewable and animations work via button

☐ Owl is viewable and animations work via button

☐ Fire is viewable and animations work via button
  ### Week 3 (Final Week)
☐ Asset mp3 and/or wav are in file

☐ Asset sounds play when button is pressed

☐ OBS recording
