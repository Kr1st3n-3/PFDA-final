# Nighttime Fun 🌌
## Repository
  https://github.com/Kr1st3n-3/PFDA-final.git
## Description
  My program will show a nighttime camp scenery with stagnat assets: fireflys, owl, and fire. The player will be prompt to click specific buttons which when pushed will activate the animations and sound for the assets
## Features
  - Firefly animation:
    
    The features it'll have is just to run through a pngs to give the illustion of animation when a button it pressed. It'll start and end in the same position so that it flows nicely.  I have a feeling im gonna need to use an if statement for the button, but that's 100% a guess. I'll probablly also need the clock feature
  - Owl animation:

  -  Asset music:
    The feature of this is just that specific sounds should play at the same time as the animations because the same button that plays the animation will also play the sound. Google says that to to this I'll need .init() and the music in the same file.
## Challenges
  For this to work ill need to learn/research and good handful of topics.

   First, I will need to research how to run animations in pygame. 

   Second, I need to learn how to get that animation to play only when I click a button and not constantly.

   Third, Ill need to learn how to input the music into pygame since Ive never actually done that before.

  Also, not really something Ill need to know cause I already know how to do it, but ill need to 2D animate these assets cause I'll need the png sequences of them to run the animations. I dont 2D animate often so I predict it'll be a challenge
## Outcomes

  ### Ideal Outcome
  My ideal outcome for this project is that everything is there when you run the program and all features work as expected. 
  ### Minimal Viable Outcome
  However, I feel like im underestimating how long and/or difficult this will be. So, my minimal outcome is that the scene opens, all the assets are there, and at least 2 animations work as intended. Everything else would be a bonus.
## Milestones

  ### Week 1 
☐ Able to open and close the pygame program

☐ Non-animated nightime scenery is viewable

☐ Animated png are in the file.
  ### Week 2
☐ Firefly is viewable and animations work via button

☐ Owl is viewable and animations work via button

☐ Fire is viewable and animations work via button
  ### Week 3 (Final Week)
☐ Asset mp4 and/or wav are in file

☐ Asset sounds play when button is pressed

☐ Extra Fixes
